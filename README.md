# Lottery DApp

A decentralized Lottery DApp built using Ethereum smart contracts and a web-based frontend. Users can participate in the lottery by sending Ether and have a chance to win the entire balance when the manager picks a winner.

## Features
- Allows users to enter the lottery by sending a specified amount of Ether.
- The manager can pick a winner randomly from the list of participants.
- The DApp displays the number of players and the list of participants.

## Technologies Used
- Solidity: For writing the smart contract.
- Ethers.js: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- MetaMask: For connecting to the user's Ethereum wallet.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the frontend interface.
- Hardhat: For Ethereum development and testing.

## Prerequisites
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.
- An Ethereum development environment like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

## Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lottery-dapp.git
   cd lottery-dapp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you are in the project directory and install the necessary npm packages.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Hardhat**
   If you haven't already set up a Hardhat environment, create a basic Hardhat configuration.
   ```bash
   npx hardhat
   ```
   Follow the prompts to create a new Hardhat project.

4. **Create and Configure the Smart Contract**

   - Create a new file `contracts/Lottery.sol` with the following content:

   ```solidity
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   contract Lottery {
       address public manager;
       address payable[] public players;

       constructor() {
           manager = msg.sender;
       }

       function participate() public payable {
           require(msg.value >= 0.01 ether, "Minimum 0.01 ether required to participate");
           players.push(payable(msg.sender));
       }

       function getNumberOfPlayers() public view returns (uint256) {
           return players.length;
       }

       function pickWinner() public restricted {
           require(players.length > 0, "No players have participated");
           uint256 winnerIndex = random() % players.length;
           address payable winner = players[winnerIndex];
           winner.transfer(address(this).balance);
           players = new address payable ; // Reset players after winner is picked
       }

       function getPlayers() public view returns (address payable[] memory) {
           return players;
       }

       function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
           return address(this).balance;
       }

       modifier restricted() {
           require(msg.sender == manager, "Only the manager can call this function");
           _;
       }

       function random() private view returns (uint256) {
           return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.difficulty, block.timestamp, players.length)));
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Compile the Contract**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

6. **Deploy the Contract**
   Create a new deployment script `scripts/deploy.js`:
   ```javascript
   async function main() {
       const Lottery = await ethers.getContractFactory("Lottery");
       const lottery = await Lottery.deploy();
       await lottery.deployed();
       console.log("Lottery contract deployed to:", lottery.address);
   }

   main()
       .then(() => process.exit(0))
       .catch((error) => {
           console.error(error);
           process.exit(1);
       });
   ```

   Then run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

   Note: Make sure you have a local Ethereum network running using:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

## Frontend Setup

1. **Update the Contract Address**
   - In `index.html`, update the `contractAddress` variable with the deployed contract address from the deployment step.

2. **Install MetaMask**
   - Install MetaMask and connect it to the local Ethereum network (usually `http://localhost:8545`).

3. **Run the Frontend**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Interacting with the DApp

1. **Enter the Lottery**
   - Click the "Enter Lottery" button. Make sure you have at least 0.01 Ether in your MetaMask account.
   
2. **Get Players**
   - Click the "Get Players" button to view the list of participants.

3. **Pick Winner**
   - Add a button for the "Pick Winner" functionality (available only to the manager). Update the frontend JavaScript to include the function to pick a winner.

## Troubleshooting

- **MetaMask Connection Issues**: Ensure MetaMask is configured to connect to the correct network.
- **Revert Errors**: Make sure all contract conditions are met (e.g., minimum Ether for participation, caller is the manager).
